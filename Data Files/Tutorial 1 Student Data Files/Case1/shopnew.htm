<h2>Shopping Good Sales This Week</h2>

<p>This week, we have plenty of your favorite summer vegetables on sale. All the vegetables we sell at Shopping Good are grown right here in the Rocky Mountains, so you know our vegetables are always fresh and delicious. Although our produce is always on sale, just check below to see how much less these vegetables cost this week than they did last week.</p>

<p><strong><em>Here's just a few of the items on sale this week:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>corn &ndash;  50 &cent; less per pack</li>
<li>carrots &ndash; 40 &cent; less per pound</li>
<li>iceberg lettuce &ndash; 30 &cent; less per head</li>
<li>string beans &ndash; 35 &cent; less per pound</li>
</ul>


<p>Although we love to see you spend time at Shopping Good, we know that you have other places to be. We've introduced new self-checkout registers at all our Shopping Good stores. Just swipe your Shopping Good savings card and you are ready to start saving on everything that's on sale in the store. If you want to really zip in and out of our stores, just grab a price scanner on the way in and take a few paper shopping bags as well. Scan the item before you place it in a bag. As you travel through the store, the price scanner will alert you to what's on sale in that aisle. You'll get discounts on items you have in your purchase history, and you will get coupons for items that are not on sale. <strong>Now that's really Shopping Good!</strong></p>
