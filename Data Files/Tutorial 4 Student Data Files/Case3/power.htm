It's energy with a "zero-carbon footprint." There is no use of fossil or nuclear fuels. In today's uncertain times, it is imperative that new solutions for today's &ndash; and tomorrow's &ndash; energy needs be implemented. When you factor in global warming and national security concerns, green energy supplied by <strong>Sierra Desert Power Solutions</strong> is the right choice at the right time.
