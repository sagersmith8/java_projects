<h1 id="top">Meeting Your Business Needs</h1>

<h2>Creating the Paper <em>Less</em> Office</h2>

<h3 class = "clear">Our Business Rationale</h3>
<p>Many offices are stocked with printers, reams of paper, filing cabinets, folders and shelving &ndash; all of which take up considerable floor space, cost money to purchase and resupply. For more than 20 years, we've been helping businesses like yours migrate from the 20th century to the 21st century by providing them with the business office solutions they need to achieve greater productivity, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. We make your workers comfortable with change and follow a slow immersion strategy. You don't have to throw out every sheet of paper in your office. We'll help you pick a launch date, whereby you can work forward to enter just your present documents into a digital system. Older documents can later be scanned or destroyed if no longer needed.</p>

<h3>The Cost Justification</h3>

<p>Most businesses today want to go paperless. That's fantasy, of course. The reality is that your company can use far less paper than it does now. Most businesses also know that going paperless is the environmentally responsible thing to do &ndash; using less paper results in greater efficiencies, reduces costs, and helps the environment. Think also about other indirect costs such as shipping paper across the nation, disposing of paper, shredding paper, and storing paper. Think again about the deforestation across the globe and the effects that it is having on our planet. We can help you get on the right track towards using less paper. If you are looking for justification for your return on investment, think about all the costs that are involved in consuming, using, storing, and distributing paper. Paper costs money, and on the average, paper prices have increased by 10% over the last 12 months alone. It costs money to purchase printers, maintain and service printers, and buy and replace toner cartridges. Converting storage rooms or "document libraries" into usable office space yields big savings each month. Think of all the filing cabinets in your office that store paper. Not only do you have to purchase office equipment to store that paper, the square footage taken up by filing cabinets quickly adds up. Here at SmallPaper Solutions, we'll get you started on the path to paper freedom and reducing or eliminating all of these costs.</p>
