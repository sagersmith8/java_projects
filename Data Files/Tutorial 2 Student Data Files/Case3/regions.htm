<h1>Recap of First Quarter Sales by Region</h1>

<!-- in the start h2 tag below, insert the code for an id named eastern -->

<h2>Eastern Region</h2>
<p>The Eastern region performed the best among all of the regions, garnering a 34% market share. This figure is impressive because the Eastern region has the fewest number of outlets and the smallest territory. Sales were particularly strong in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. The expansion of our outlets in Pittsburgh and Buffalo made significant contributions to the overall success of the Eastern region. Sales were up regionally by 11.3% over the first-quarter sales from a year ago. A new marketing campaign advertising winter weather gear was particularly effective in New England and the greater Boston area in particular.</p>

<h2>Western Region</h2>
<p>The Western region saw a slight decline in sales. This is particularly troubling because the Western region already has the lowest market share of any region. Sales were particularly weak in the Rocky Mountain area, although a very bad winter with severe storms could be somewhat responsible for the downturn in sales. Regional sales were also hampered by delays in opening new outlets in San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle. The shipping strike has been making it difficult to receive building supplies needed to construct new outlets. Serious slippage in the timetable to open new outlets has been common. Although the strike has been settled, there is quite a back up in meeting demand for all sorts of commodities, including building supplies. We expect the region to improve over the next year, but the remaining quarters of this year may prove to be a challenge. We are considering ramping up our sales and marketing in this region.</p>

<!-- in the start h2 tag below, insert the code for an id named northern -->

<h2>Northern Region</h2>
<p>Sales in the Northern region were particularly weak. Numerous bad weather events, coupled with record cold, certainly resulted in diminished foot traffic in our stores. The only bright spot was the Chicago area, where sales actually increased by 5.3% over the same period last year. The cold weather did impact our sales of outerwear, which led the region and sales of which were up by more than 20% from last year. With no new regional expansion slated for the remainder of this year, we expect sales in this region to barely hold their own. The opening of new stores in Detroit and Cleveland, however, will certainly add to the bottom line, but not for the next five quarters at least. Flooding along the Mississippi has stymied river freight over the last few weeks, so inventories are not at desired levels and we are not positioned well to switch to the spring clothing line.</p>

<h2>Southern Region</h2>

<p>The Southern region showed marked improvement from the same period last year. Sales in the Southern region now rival those of the Eastern region. Particularly strong was spring and summer outerwear, as an early spring and unseasonably warm weather took hold in February and have remained in play since then. The Southern region also benefitted from the expansion of new stores in New Orleans, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, and Tallahassee. Sales were up a remarkable 42% from the same period last year. No other region saw such strong growth. An aggressive marketing campaign and the store expansions in the aforementioned cities have coupled to make this the most successful region this quarter. We project that the Southern region may have the overall largest market share by the end of the year.</p>
