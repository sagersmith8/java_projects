<h1>Our Gift Shop is Now Open!</h1>
<p>After more than six months of renovations, we are pleased to announce that our Gift Shop is open again to serve our guests. Our gift shop, of course, has all the souvenirs you want, but in addition, we now have a full line of sportswear in every size and at every price point. We even have our own line of designer sportswear customized with the Sundown logo. You can wear these items anywhere and be in style no matter what the season or the setting.</p>

<p>Come to the gift shop and try on shorts, shirts, and swimwear. We have hooded jackets as well for those summer nights when there still is a chill in the air. We also have hiking gear, boots, and all sorts of hiking paraphernalia. We also carry a full line of personal items that you either forgot to bring with you on your visit or have simply run out of while you were here.</p>  

<p>If you are looking for a snack before or after our main dining facilities close, come to the gift shop and have some coffee, tea, juice, and a light breakfast. We have sit-down and take out service as well.</p>

<p>Planning on going for a hike or participating in a challenging sports activity?  If so, stock up now on healthful snacks and low-calorie, high-carb beverages to take along with you. If you do purchase food for take out to your lodge or on the trail, please be mindful of disposing of containers and trash in a responsible manner. We have recycling drops throughout the Sundown campus.</p>

<p>Our gift shop offers you one lasting gift &mdash; competitive prices. You won't feel that you've been overcharged just for visiting our gift shop. We have fair and competitive prices on all the items we stock, from designer sportswear to a cup of great coffee. You are our guests, and we want to see you back here again in the future. We want you to know that the Sundown Spa and Resort value your patronage, and we want to see you again as a repeat customer. We know that our guests are consumers, too, and we want you to know that you will enjoy every part of your stay here. It's the memories of your visit that will be priceless, not what you purchase here.</p>
