<h3>Handling</h3>

<p>You'll get the most enjoyment from your vinyl recordings if you use the 
proper care. Avoid touching the playing surface of any record. Handle the 
record on its side edges only. Don't leave your records in a horizontal 
position. When you are not playing a record, store the record in a 
vertical position in a record rack in its protective sleeve. Don't use a 
plastic or metal rack to store your records unless you have placed the record 
first in its protective sleeve.</p>

<h3>Cleaning</h3>

<p>Clean your disks frequently, particularly after you have played a recording. 
You want to ensure there is no damage from dust and static, and you want to make sure that 
you will be storing your disks safely as well. We stock a wide variety 
of cleaning materials and cloths for eliminating dust and static from your 
records. Above all, do not use tap water, which might contain harmful 
minerals and chemicals, to clean your records. Use either spring water or a 
water-based solution that contains not more than 20% isopropyl alcohol. 
Cleaning solutions are very effective at removing dust, dirt, and other 
contaminants that the record may have encountered, especially during the handling 
process. Clean the disk in the direction of the grooves, never against the 
direction of the grooves, which might cause tiny particles from the cleaning cloth to collect 
on the recording surface.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>You want to get the longest life from your records, so the proper storage of 
your records is key to maintaining the enjoyment of your records for years to 
come. Consider the temperature and humidity of the room where you will be 
storing your records. Store your records in an environment that will be 
heated in winter and cooled during the summer. Don't store your records in 
an attic or a garage, where temperature extremes might cause warping or other 
damage to the record. An environment of 60-70 degrees is best, and 
humidity in the range of 33-50%. You don't want your records being damaged 
by heat or humidity. Never store your records where there is any exposure 
to sunlight. Also be mindful of other room factors that might affect the 
heat level next to the disks, such as heaters, vents, air conditioners, and 
lighting. Avoid dusty environments such as an attic or basement. 
Keep your recordings (vertically) in an airtight container, a cabinet with 
doors, or a sealable box. If your home or apartment has an open-floor 
layout, be mindful that smoke and cooking greases from the kitchen or outdoor 
barbeques can affect your records as well.</p>
