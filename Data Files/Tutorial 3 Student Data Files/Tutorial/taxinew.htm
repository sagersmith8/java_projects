<h1>Tanner Taxi</h1>
<h2>We Have the Greenest Yellow Cabs</h2>

<p>Make <strong><em>Tanner Taxi</em></strong> your one stop for your transportation needs in and around
the Bennings area. Not only do we offer car service in the Bennings area, we also
have <strong>regularly scheduled</strong> van service to Mobile each day. We also have scheduled service
to Mobile <em>on Friday and Saturday evenings.</em> We offer limousine service to and from
Mobile as well. We also offer car service to all the major golf courses in the area.</p>

<h3>Our Modern Fleet</h3>

<p>All our vehicles are either hybrid or electric vehicles. When you ride with us,
you are doing yourself and the environment a favor. We have recently added six new
all-electric vehicles for short trips here in Bennings. Need a larger vehicle
than a passenger car? Call for our SUV, van, or limousine service. We have vans
that comfortably fit up to 16 passengers, and there is ample space for luggage as well.
If you need special service or if you just want to travel in a more luxurious manner, we
have limousine service within Bennings and also to and from Mobile.</p>

<h3>Corporate Accounts</h3>

<p>You can charge your car service through your corporate account and receive a
monthly statement. There is no easier way to keep track of your expenses. We also
offer an annual statement billing that summarizes all of the services provided to
your company for the entire year. Use this statement for your accounting or tax
purposes. The annual statement also makes it easy to audit the services provided
to eliminate employee fraud or abuse.</p>

<h3>We Never Close</h3>

<p>Our services are available all day and all night, seven days a week and 365 days
a year. We are always here when you need us. There are no extra charges or surtaxes
for holiday service or for off-hour and nightly service. We charge one flat rate
for all services. You pay a fair fare at all times. Our drivers are experienced,
professional, and courteous. You will not only enjoy your ride, enjoy paying a reasonable
rate for services, but you will also appreciate traveling with drivers who know
the area, have excellent driving records, and who are deeply concerned about customer
satisfaction. We also offer emergency service if you need a designated driver. We
do our best to keep the Bennings area roads safe at night. Let us be your designated
driver.</p>
